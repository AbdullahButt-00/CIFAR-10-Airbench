Prior work
This project builds on the excellent previous record [https://github.com/tysam-code/hlb-CIFAR10](https://github.com/tysam-code/hlb-CIFAR10) (6.3 A100-seconds to 94%).
Which itself builds on the amazing series [https://myrtle.ai/learn/how-to-train-your-resnet/](https://myrtle.ai/learn/how-to-train-your-resnet/) (26 V100-seconds to 94%, which is >=8 A100-seconds)
